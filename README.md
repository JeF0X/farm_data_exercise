# Farm data pre-assigment exercise

NOTE: Unfortunatly I started working on this too late and wasn't able to get the app to a shape I'm happy with. For a better example of my skills please check this crypto app exercise I did as pre-assigment for another job: https://github.com/JeF0X/rising_star_crypto_app.

## Running the app
You can try the app at: https://farm-data-exercise.web.app

The web version uses a fake data service to supply the data so there is no need to run a server.
